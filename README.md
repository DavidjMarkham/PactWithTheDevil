# Pact With The Devil

A small game I made in under 48 hours for the Ludum Dare 44 game jam. Ludum Dare Compo is a game jam competition where you are challenged to create a game from scratch based on a specific theme in under 48 hours. All artwork, sound, code, etc. has to be made in that time window. I definitely wasn't able to add nearly as many features as I would have liked, and didn't do as well as I was aiming for (I got 480th overall out of about 2,500 entries) but learned a lot during it. You can play the game I made for the game jam for yourself here:  https://dmarkham421.itch.io/devil-and-aliens-georgia
